1.Data     
 
2.Aesthetics :  mapping between data and visual aesthetics.The visual elements of a plot, or aesthetics, 
                include lines, points, symbols, colors, position . . . anything that you can see.
                You use the special function aes() to set up a mapping between data and aesthetics. 
                Each argument to aes() maps a column in your data to a specific element in your geom.
                In ggplot2, you use the + operator to combine the different layers of the plot.
                you use the aes() function to define the mapping between your data and your plot.
                We can override aesthetics using aes() in other layers.
                we can use 1.mapping using aesthetics or 2.setting.
                Setting is easy compared to mapping.
                If u want to set color don't use aesthetics.If u want to map a color to a variable then use 
                aesthetics.
