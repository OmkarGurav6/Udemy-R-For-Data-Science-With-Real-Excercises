
$ sign doesn't work for matrices but it does work for data frames.

In matrix if we extract 1 row it will turn into vector.
In dataframe it will stay as a dataframe. But when we extract 1 column it will give vector.
To get dataframe we use drop = F parameter as we use in matrix.

We can use merge function to merge dataframes.
